Hello! I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Communication](https://comm.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"}, where I am a member of the [Stanford Social Media Lab](https://sml.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"} and am advised by [Jeff Hancock](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fU4Y4fEAAAAJ){:target="_blank"}. 

My research program focuses on older adults' digital media and technology use. Most broadly, I am interested in identifying how older adults can use digital media and technology to enhance health and well-being, as well as understanding ways to help older adults build resilience to online threats such as mis/disinformation and scams.
