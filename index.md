Hello! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Communication](https://comm.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"}, where I am a member of the [Stanford Social Media Lab](https://sml.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"} and am advised by Professor [Jeff Hancock](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fU4Y4fEAAAAJ){:target="_blank"}. I recieved two B.S. degrees, in Economics and Political Science, from [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/){:target="_blank"}, where I was a member of the [Communication and Cognitive Systems Lab](https://www.commcogsystems.com/index.html){:target="_blank"}.

My research program focuses on older adults' digital media and technology use. Most broadly, I am interested in identifying how older adults can use digital media and technology to enhance health and well-being, as well as understanding ways to help older adults build resilience to online threats such as mis/disinformation and scams. My other research explores how people encounter, process, and engage with (problematic) information online. I use a diveristy of methods in my work, including large-scale digital trace data, online and lab experiments, surveys, content analysis, and computational linguistics.
