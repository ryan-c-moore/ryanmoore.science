Hello! I am an [Assistant Professor](https://ischool.utexas.edu/profiles/ryan-moore){:target="_blank"} in the [School of Information](https://ischool.utexas.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My research examines media and technology use across the lifespan, with a particular focus on older adults. I am interested in identifying how individuals—especially older adults—can effectively use media and technology to pursue everyday goals, as well as understanding ways to help build resilience to online threats such as scams and other forms of deception. I use a variety of methods in my work, including large-scale digital trace data, online and lab experiments, surveys, content analysis, and computational linguistics.

Before joining UT Austin, I earned a PhD in communication from Stanford University, where I was a member of the [Stanford Social Media Lab](https://sml.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"} and the [Stanford Lifespan Development Lab](https://lifespan.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"}. I also spent a year as a [New Map of Life Fellow](https://longevity.stanford.edu/ryan-moore/){:target="_blank"} at the [Stanford Center on Longevity](https://longevity.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"}.
